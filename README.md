# My Very First Web Page

Welcome! [Code Institute](http://codeinstitute.net)

This is my first project in the code institute learning videos to be posted into the github. It is very minimal and may have some bugs to fix but is not bad for my first ever web-page.


## Technology Used:

<li>html</li>
<li>css</li>

## Rationale for this exercise:

The purpose of designing this webpage was not only to reinforce certain css and html skills learnt so far but also to fully understand how to amend, create and publish a project using the gitpod and github software.
